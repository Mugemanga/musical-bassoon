             brother.”The crest and crowning of all good, 
             life's final star, is brotherhood.”A brother is a friend given by

             I would run through the woods and feel quite safe.”“A brother

             stories to the inevitable dusk.”I don't have much to worry about when I have an angel, 
             called brother, watching over me.”
